🎓 **About Me**  
I’m a Togolese software developer currently completing a Bachelor's Degree in IT Management at ESAG-NDE. I enjoy building clean and efficient solutions — from desktop stock systems to web platforms using Django or Laravel. I'm also interested in cybersecurity, API development, and mobile apps with Flutter.  
Always learning, always improving.
